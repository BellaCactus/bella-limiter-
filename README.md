## what is this?

**bella limiter** is a small desktop tool that helps manage network behavior through simple, toggleable profiles.

it exists for two main reasons:

- **destiny 2 workflow convenience (pve)**  
  quick switching between preset network states without digging through settings every time

- **general network testing**
  stability checks, troubleshooting, and repeatable “known good” configurations

this repo is kept as a record of the project, its features, and how it evolved.

---

## highlights

- fast enable/disable toggles
- preset profiles for repeatable setups
- minimal UI designed for quick use while a game/app is running
- focused on qol over complexity

---

## intended use

this tool is meant for:

- connection testing / troubleshooting
- traffic shaping for stability checks
- quickly switching between personal network presets
- general “one click” qol network management

important note:
- use responsibly and follow the rules of any online service/game you use it with  
- this tool is not affiliated with bungie or destiny 2
